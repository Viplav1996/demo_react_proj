Task tracker applications froms the basics of data handling in a list.
The functionality provieded here would be to add tasks, delete tasks, store them on local database.
Its pretty convinent to do as it form a base of CRUD model of any database as well.
The special extension I installed for this project is ES7/React/GrapQl in Microsoft Visual Studio Code.
'rafce' : a coomand to instroduce a class in the JavaScript file by the name file itself(saves time instead of writing arrow function).
'props' : One of the best way to call a functionality of an independent file by exporting it. E.g. <Task />(Task file and functions will be exported with arguments as well).
Props also provide opportunity to be used again and again. E.g. <Button />.  <Button onCLick={onClick} />, <Button color={color} text={text} /> etc.
