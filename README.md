      JSX is not understood by the browser. It needs to be compiled to plain JavaScript, which the browser can understand.

      The most commonly used compiler for JSX is called Babel.
      
      
      
 All React apps require three things:

ReactDOM.render(): used to render (show) our app by mounting it onto an HTML element
A JSX element: called a "root node", because it is the root of our application. Meaning, rendering it will render all children within it
An HTML (DOM) element: Where the app is inserted within an HTML page. The element is usually a div with an id of "root", located in an index.html file.
